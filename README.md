# Internet Security & Malware Analysis Mini Project

**Problem Statement: **
To Design and Implement a Network Monitoring Tool with ARP Spoofing Detection and Defense Mechanisms

**Objectives:**
Design and develop a python based tool capable of scanning local area networks and detecting active devices.
Monitor and detect ARP spoofing attacks.
Develop real-time defense mechanisms against ARP spoofing to safeguard network integrity.
Develop a user-friendly custom GUI for simplifying the process of traffic analysis, logging, and reporting.

**Proposed System:**
The proposed system will be built in python, primarily using Scapy, Tkinter and nmap. It will be divided into the following modules.

1. Network Scanning Module
2. Spoofing Detection Module
3. Spoofing Defense Module
4. Traffic Monitoring and Logging Module
5. GUI Module
